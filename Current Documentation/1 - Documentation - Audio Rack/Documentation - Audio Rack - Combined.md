## Guidelines and rules 
Please contact an IS Lab Staff team member for any and all questions about the guidelines listed below.

1. Leave all food and drinks outside of the lab on the designated table in Zone A of the library.
2. **Do not clean any deck’s audio heads. Please ask a staff member for assistance.**
3. If any equipment or software stops working or breaks during transfer, **immediately contact an IS Lab staff team member** for assistance.
4. **All tapes need to be inspected before using any deck** to ensure the tape is safe to transfer. For any questions about the quality of a tape, ask an IS Lab staff member. 
> a. If the magnetic material on the tape looks broken or cracked, it is very possible that the tape has been affected by **Sticky-shed syndrome**. Refer to [Appendix B]() for more information on sticky-shed syndrome.
5. Keeping audiotape away from humid temperatures is highly recommended. Whenever possible, store in air-tight containers. 
6. For certain tapes, baking is a requirement in the IS Lab in order to ensure the preservation of our vintage equipment. For guidelines on baking, please visit [Appendix C: Baking](). 
7. For first-time use of decks and first-time audio transfers, please reach out to a member of the IS Lab Staff for assistance.
8. If materials needed to complete a project are lacking or out of stock (e.g. gloves, alcohol, etc.), please inform a member of the IS Lab Staff so that they may place an inventory request. 
9. Copy files to the appropriate IS Lab server folder or to a personal storage device after transferring. **Do not leave files on the transfer computer’s hard drive or desktop**—all files are deleted from the computer at the end of each week.



## Pre-Digitization

### Audio rack workflow

#### Identifying audio formats and choosing the correct deck 
Prior to digitization, it is necessary to identify the correct deck and format for media transfers. Refer to [Appendix A]() and the [list of audio formats in the overview section]() to identify the format of a selected tape, choose the correct deck for playback, prepare the media prior to transfer, and ensure the protection of equipment while working with the audio rack transfer station.

After identifying formats and decks for digitization, contact a lab staff team member to ensure all heads are clean prior to proceeding with the transfer. This step ensures that the transfer of information will be smooth and accurate.

#### Required inspection
**Inspection is required before playing back any media in the audio rack.** Inspection helps to ensure that transfers will not cause undue stress or damage to IS Lab equipment. The inspection process also aids the identification of the proper settings for a given piece of media, which will ensure a clean transfer. 

**Equipment in the audio rack is expensive and/or obsolete, and replacement parts can be difficult to come by. Therefore, IS Lab kindly asks for the exercise of attention and caution during the use of all equipment, so as to mitigate costly repairs. This starts with the inspection process.**

#### Cassette Tapes
1. Check for signs of microbial growth. Mold may appear as fuzzy threadlike or hairy growth on the tape pack.Typically, these growths are white in color although they may also be black, brown, or mustard-colored. **Do not playback for any tape showing signs of fungal growth in the IS Lab. Likewise, in the case of uncertainty about fungal growth, do not attempt playback.** 
2. Check tape using the plastic window for pack/wind issues, stretching, twists, or creases. See that the tape path is tight and fed straight across the pads, pinch rollers, and hub teeth. 
3. The type of tape will change its susceptibility to deterioration, resulting in high-end dropout at the start of the tape.
4. Consider tape length (90, 100, 110, or 120 min) and likelihood of getting caught, stretched, and damaged in the machine.
5. Inspect pads, pinch rollers, hub teeth, and protective slips. 
6. Rehousing and repair:
> Pull the tape tightly against the supply reel to ensure the leader is securely attached. If it unwinds unevenly during an initial hand winding, rehouse or repair the tape before playback.
7. Ensure that a sufficient amount of leader is attached and in good enough condition for playback.
8. Assess the overall safety of playing tape and anticipate any potential difficulties  to monitor during playback.
9. Determine the ideal storage conditions for longevity (container, shelf orientation, temperature and humidity controls).
10. **Check the slots on the top of tape, to identify it as a Type I, Type Il, or Type IV tape.** This verifies that the settings on the tape deck are correct to ensure proper playback. For assistance, refer to the chart below:
