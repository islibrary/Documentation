# IS Library & Media Preservation Lab: Thermocenter oven documentation

## Overview
This document provides instructions for baking ¼” open reel audiotape and U-Matic videotape in the Thermocenter oven.

As audio tape deteriorates, the magnetic material may separate from the plastic base, resulting in sticky-shed syndrome. Baking is a procedure intended to re-plasticize the tape and adhere the information, by placing it for an extended period in a tape oven. Some sound experts and preservationists view this as a last resort, as **it will irreversibly change the magnetic chemistry of the tape**. There is not a single, universally-followed procedure for baking; different technicians have different methods. On occasion, baking a tape enables transfer to a more stable media format. However, even the best technicians admit that certain tapes cannot be improved with baking. If most of the oxide coating is gone, no amount of baking can render the tape usable.

¾” Umatic videotape is one of the most problematic video formats that exist, due to the risk of sticky shed syndrome which afflicts the polyester base. For this reason, **all Umatic tapes must be baked in the Thermocenter Oven prior to being played back. This requirement helps us to protect our vintage equipment, in addition to the tape itself**.
