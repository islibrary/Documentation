# IS Library and Media Preservation Lab: Thermocenter oven documentation

## Overview
This document provides instructions for baking ¼” open reel audiotape and U-Matic videotape in the Thermocenter oven.

As audio tape deteriorates, the magnetic material may separate from the plastic base, resulting in sticky-shed syndrome. Baking is a procedure intended to re-plasticize the tape and adhere the information, by placing it for an extended period in a tape oven. Some sound experts and preservationists view this as a last resort, as **it will irreversibly change the magnetic chemistry of the tape**. There is not a single, universally-followed procedure for baking; different technicians have different methods. On occasion, baking a tape enables transfer to a more stable media format. However, even the best technicians admit that certain tapes cannot be improved with baking. If most of the oxide coating is gone, no amount of baking can render the tape usable.

¾” Umatic videotape is one of the most problematic video formats that exist, due to the risk of sticky shed syndrome which afflicts the polyester base. For this reason, **all Umatic tapes must be baked in the Thermocenter Oven prior to being played back. This requirement helps us to protect our vintage equipment, in addition to the tape itself**.

## Rules and Guidelines
* **Assistance by an IS Lab Staff member is required** in order to bake audiotape or videotape in the ThermoCenter tape oven.
* **The goal of baking is not to fully restore the tape, but to render it usable enough to be transferred to a more stable medium.**
* <ins>Treat each baking session as a test.</ins> If the tape’s issues persist, repeat the baking process once and note if there is improvement. **If no progress is made after the second baking attempt, the tape should not be used.**
* Let the oven stabilize before baking the tape.
* Check the temperature each hour, as much as possible.
* After baking, tapes **must be left at room temperature for at least 24 hours prior** to being worked on or transferred.
* **Do not bake acetate tape.** Only polyester tape is bakeable. 

## Operating the Thermocenter

### Prep the tape

#### Open Reel Audio Tape

When handling open-reel audio tape, it is crucial to determine whether the tape's base is made of acetate or polyester. These materials degrade in distinct ways and, therefore, necessitate different treatment methods.

It is important to note that **only polyester-based** audio tape should be subjected to the baking process. **Baking acetate-based tape can result in damage** to both the tape and the recorded content. When identifying the base material of audio tape, it is helpful to remember that its appearance is the opposite of film bases.

Acetate tape allows light to pass through and cannot be baked. Polyester tape is opaque under light and bakeable.

There is no universally-embraced recipe for baking audiotape. The IS Lab staff has included the following three recipes below. Please consult IS Lab well before planning on baking audio tape, so they may assist with setting up a deck to wind the tape onto a baking reel. Keep in mind that the tape will have to be played at regular speed to wind onto the proper reel. Baking will take at least 3 hours plus the time to have the oven heat up to the proper temperature. Allow for 24 hours for the tape to cool after baking before attempting playback. Please factor in the timing before starting your tape baking project. Follow according to preference and severity of the tape’s preservation risks. 

Before baking, **tapes on plastic reels should be wound onto large reels with NAB hubs.** Baking on plastic reels could cause the plastic to warp and make it extremely difficult to get the tape off the reel. The metal reel may be found in the IS Media Lab on Shelf D next to the vinyl. Use the reel in the box that is marked for baking tape. NAB hubs can be found on top of the Otari decks.

Ask lab staff to help set up the [ask Casey which deck this should be] to wind the tape onto the metal reel for baking. It is very important to not use any of the functioning, quality decks in the lab as running tapes with SSS along heads could deposit oxide and damage the heads. To wind, place the tape on the supply side of the deck and the metal reel on the right side of the deck and press “Play” to achieve an even ‘library wind’ before baking. 

Once the tape has been properly wound onto the metal reel, place the reel onto the metal tray, then put it on a shelf in the oven. Follow one of the recipes below for baking instructions.

#### Method 1: From Ampex

1. Bake the tape at 130 F (55.4 C), +/- 5 degrees (+/- 51.67- 57.2) , and 10% humidity, +/- 5% (Fan at 60% on Thermocenter). For ¼ inch tape, bake for 2 to 4 hours. 
2. After the heating cycle, allow the tape to stand overnight to cool and stabilize. The tape should be usable for approximately one month.
3. Rewind the tape at normal playback tension in both directions. Leave the tape tail out if it is not to be copied immediately. 

#### Method 2: From 3M

1. Bake the tape at 130 F (55.4 C), +/- 5 degrees (+/- 51.67- 57.2). For ¼ inch tape, bake for 4 hours. Set fan to 60% on thermocenter. 
2. According to 3M, there is no need to worry about the electric fields generated by an electric oven.
3. After completion of the heating cycle, allow the oven and tape to return to room temperature naturally.
