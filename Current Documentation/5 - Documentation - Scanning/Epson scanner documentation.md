# IS Library and Media Preservation Lab: Epson Scanner documentation
Last updated: May 7, 2024

## Overview
The Epson scanner workflow documentation provides instructions for every stage of the scanning process for still images, documents, and film, including:
1. **Pre-scanning:** Understanding the rules, guidelines, tips, and tricks which will result in the highest quality scan of selected materials as efficiently as possible. This includes identifying different types of film, configuring scanner and software settings, recommended archival standards for digitization, and practices to avoid.
2. **Scanning:** Navigating the physical placement of materials on the scanner, using the EPSON Scan software, and making adjustments during the scanning process so as to achieve the ideal scan.
3. **Post-scanning:** Inspecting and verifying the finished scan for quality, as well as file management considerations for the long-term storage of digitized materials.

The Epson scanner is located at the Scanning Station, in Zone C of the IS Library, by the Mac computers. The Epson scanner is connected to the Mac desktop directly adjacent to the wall; this computer must be used for all scanning purposes. In order to use the scanner, please [book an appointment for the Scanning Station via Appointlet](https://dashboard.appointlet.com/profiles/47049/scheduling-pages/48115?updatingMeetingTypeId=293569).

While some countries’ laws permit limited copying of copyright material in certain circumstances, those circumstances may not be as broad as some people assume. [Each user must be] responsible and respectful of the copyright laws when using digital cameras, scanners, and ink jet printers.”
