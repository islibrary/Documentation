# IS Library and Media Preservation Lab: Epson Scanner documentation
Last updated: May 7, 2024

## Overview
The Epson scanner workflow documentation provides instructions for every stage of the scanning process for still images, documents, and film, including:
1. **Pre-scanning:** Understanding the rules, guidelines, tips, and tricks which will result in the highest quality scan of selected materials as efficiently as possible. This includes identifying different types of film, configuring scanner and software settings, recommended archival standards for digitization, and practices to avoid.
2. **Scanning:** Navigating the physical placement of materials on the scanner, using the EPSON Scan software, and making adjustments during the scanning process so as to achieve the ideal scan.
3. **Post-scanning:** Inspecting and verifying the finished scan for quality, as well as file management considerations for the long-term storage of digitized materials.

The Epson scanner is located at the Scanning Station, in Zone C of the IS Library, by the Mac computers. The Epson scanner is connected to the Mac desktop directly adjacent to the wall; this computer must be used for all scanning purposes. In order to use the scanner, please [book an appointment for the Scanning Station via Appointlet](https://dashboard.appointlet.com/profiles/47049/scheduling-pages/48115?updatingMeetingTypeId=293569).

## Considerations for photographs and documents

* **The maximum document size** allowed by the scanner is **12.2” x 17.2” (310 x 437 mm).** However, the most common size used in the U.S. is Ledger or B-size (11” x 17”). Any materials larger than 12.22” x 17.2” or 310mm x 437mm **should not** be scanned with the Epson; they are better suited to a copy stand instead, so as to prevent denting or damage to the materials. **This is especially important to consider for fragile, valuable, and antique documents that are oversized.**
* FADGI, the Federal Agencies Digital Guidelines Initiative, recommends the following specifications for the scanning of 2-D materials (refer to the chart below). Please configure the Epson SCAN software settings accordingly:

| Type of material | Recommended Resolution | Recommended File Format |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Documents, maps, posters, newspapers, and manuscripts | 400ppi (pixels per inch) | TIFF, JPG 2000, or PDF/A |
| Prints, photographs, and film | 600 ppi | TIFF or JPEG 2000 |
| Photographic transparencies 4x5 inch or larger | 2000 ppi | TIFF or JPEG 2000 file |
| Photographic transparencies, from 35mm to 4x5 inch | 4000 ppi | TIFF or JPEG 2000 |
| Photographic negatives, 35mm to 4x5 inch | 4000 ppi | TIFF or JPEG 2000 |
| Photographic negatives, 4x5 inch or larger | 2000 ppi | TIFF or JPEG 2000 |
| Paintings and 2-dimensional fine art | 600 ppi | TIFF or JPEG 2000 |

## Scanning workflow
### Placing materials on the scanner.

Please follow the directions relevant for the materials to be scanned.

**Placing a single photo or single-page document:**
1. Raise the scanner cover and place the document face-down on the document table. Place it in the upper-left hand corner, aligning it with the edges of the glass.
2. Close the document cover, being careful not to move the document or photo.
> a. If the edges of the document or photo do not scan properly, adjust by moving it inwards about 1/16 of an inch away from the edges of the glass.
3. To scan a thick item, such as a photo in an album, lift the back of the cover straight up. When reinserting the cover, line up the hinge pins with the positioning holes. Then lower the cover into place.
> a. **A note regarding multi-page documents:** FADGI guidelines dissuade the use of an automatic document feeder, or ADF. This is due to the probability of unwanted artifacts appearing in the scan. Please refer to Using Adobe Acrobat to combine multiple Scanned PDFs into a multi-page document for instructions on how to compile multiple pages into a single document.
