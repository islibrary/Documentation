# IS Library and Media Preservation Lab: Zoom Recorder workflow documentation

## Overview 

The Zoom recorder workflow documentation provides step-by-step instructions for using the Zoom H4n Pro audio recording devices and includes: 

1. An introductory guide for using the Zoom H4n Pro
2. General guidelines and considerations for interviewing and audio recording
3. Post interview procedures (e.g. accessing your audio files)

## Using the Zoom h4n: An Introductory Guide

1. ﻿﻿﻿Turn on the device by holding the power switch (located on the left side) down for approximately one second until the screen is activated.
2. ﻿﻿﻿Next press the red record button to see levels.
3. ﻿﻿﻿Place the device where you intend to have it for the interview and do a sound test where your subject talks at the volume anticipated for the interview. Watch the levels while this is done. Ensure that the levels are between -12 and -6 when at their highest point (presumably the subject's highest register). You do not want the levels close to 0, as this will clip and cut off sound. You alter levels by pressing the rec level buttons on the right side of the device. Be sure you are not using the similar looking volume button when attempting to adjust levels.
4. ﻿﻿﻿Once you have achieved the desired levels, push the red record button and conduct your interview.
5. To conclude your interview, you can hit the stop button (the square) or the record button again.
6. ﻿﻿﻿To turn off the device, hold down the power button again for approximately one second until all shuts down.

## Guidelines for Interviewing

1. When testing levels with the interviewee, have them speak more loudly than they may initially feel inclined. This will ensure that the peaks are falling in the ideal range (usually between -12 and -6 dB).
2. The vertical bars on the Zoom recorder’s display indicate where the peaks are falling in the decibel range. Monitor this information closely; it will indicate whether or not to adjust the gain (also called recording level) on the device, and where to place the recorder in relation to the interviewee.
3. If your peaks are below -12 dB, increase the gain accordingly with the + button on the right side of the recorder. If your peaks are above -6dB, decrease the gain accordingly with the – button.
4. Tripods are preferable to handheld use because the Zoom can be mounted securely to the tripod, by screwing the device onto the tripod peg. This minimizes noise caused by hands and fingers. 
5. For handheld use, avoid tapping your fingers on the recorder or shifting your grip while recording, which will be audible. Hold the device firmly with one or both hands, whatever feels more comfortable for you. Do not cover or touch the mics with your fingers. Hold the device as stationary as possible to minimize shake. Anchoring your elbows or arms on a table will help to keep the Zoom stationary.
6. When selecting an interview site, avoid windy and outdoor environments if possible. 
7. When recording inside, be mindful of the room tone, which will feature in your recording. Avoid conducting interviews in more than one room, as room tones can vary greatly and differences in room tone are very noticeable in the final recording. If your finished recording has a loud or distracting room tone, you can reduce it using audio editing software in the Media Lab. Ask a staff member for more information.

### Additional considerations

1. You can monitor recording real-time with headphones, as well as listen to stored recordings, via the Zoom recorder’s 3.5mm headphone jack (left side of device).
2. It is preferable for the Zoom recorder to be closer to your interviewee with the gain adjusted down, rather than the inverse. This will ensure greater clarity of vocal characteristics, and will lend the recording a more intimate feel.
3. If you have access to a Boom mic or other high-quality microphone, it can be connected to the Zoom with an XLR cable, on the bottom of the device. Once an external mic is connected, it will bypass the Zoom’s built-in mic and record with the external mic instead.

## Accessing your Audio Files

Once your interview session is complete, use the following instructions to access your recording:

**Remove the SD card:**
1. Open the flap on the right side of the Zoom recorder.
2. Press down on the SD card until it pops up to remove.

**Transfer files:**
1. Insert the SD card into the Audio Post Production Station computer's SD card reader.
> a. If you are unable to find the card reader, ask lab staff for assistance.
2. Drag your audio files onto your personal hard drive.
3. Before removing the SD card, right-click and select "Eject" on the computer’s SD card icon on the computer.
