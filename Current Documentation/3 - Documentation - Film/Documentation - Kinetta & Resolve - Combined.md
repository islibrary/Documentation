# IS Library and Media Preservation Lab: Kinetta and DaVinci Resolve documentation

*Last updated: March 5, 2024*

## Overview
The Kinetta workflow documentation provides instructions for every stage of the film scanning process, including:

1. **Pre-scan inspection:** Examining the state and quality of the film, and taking note of technical damage or deterioration which may impact the scanning process.
2. **Loading film:** Winding film onto a core and properly threading it through the machine.
3. **Configuring settings:** Setting up the Kinetta software to properly capture and stabilize image information, and adjusting exposure to get a clear image.
4. **Capture process:** Using the Kinetta software to create a scanned, digital copy of the film for long-term file storage and preservation.
5. **Post-production:** Using DaVinci Resolve for color correction and AEO-Light for adjustments to optical sound.

The Kinetta in the IS Lab supports the following film formats: **8mm, Super 8, 16mm, 35mm.**
