# Adjusting the Waveform and CRT Monitors

## 1. How to read a waveform and vectorscope signal
**1.1 Waveform:** A waveform is used to evaluate the brightness/luminance of your image, regardless of the color. The units are in IRE, and there are a total of 140 of them. 

The illustration below is of a waveform monitor reticule. While it has several mysterious things included in the graphics, the most important are the horizontal lines that go from 100 at the top to -40 at the bottom with a heavy subdivided line about a third of the way up from the bottom at 0 on this scale. These are the primary measuring lines.

The video portion of the scale is from zero to one hundred, while the area below zero is for synchronizing signals. The area between 7.5 and 0 IRE is referred to as super black. While the technical issue that plagued early television sets has long ago been solved, this artificially high black level is the standard for NTSC video.Note also that there are two lines above 100 at 110 and 120 IRE. This is called the Superwhite area, where really strong light peaks (glints of the sun off shiny objects, for instance) may travel. What we perceive as white on a monitor is not 100 IRE but is actually around 75 to 85 IRE depending upon the visual content of the picture. So you should think of 100 IRE and above not as whites but as highlights that are a normal part of the picture. As an illustration, look at the waveform below on the left:

The image of the gray scale is represented in the waveform on the left. We see a simple “staircase” test signal that has levels at 0, 20, 40, 60, 80, and 100 IRE from the left to the right. The step on the left would be below black, the next step dark gray, the next step a bit lighter gray, and so on until we get to white.

Additionally, the image in a waveform corresponds from left to right, while the top to bottom is the representation of the brightness. Looking at the two images above, we can see the image of the man reading on the waveform on the right. While the dark hallway on the left of the image reads at around 10 IRE on the left of the waveform, the window on the right is reading at around 90 IRE on the right of the waveform.

Waveform clipping is when the peaks of your waveform are being cut off by the top of the frame. Make sure the image isn’t clipping because it means information is being cut off. If your waveform is clipping, you will need to adjust the settings on the TBC.

**1.2 Vectorscope:**A vectorscope is basically a color wheel. It displays the hue and saturation information in the image. It does not provide any information on the brightness of your image. The further the markings are from the center, the more saturation you have in your image. The cross hair in the center of the wheel represents zero saturation.
