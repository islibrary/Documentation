# Adjusting the Waveform and CRT Monitors

## 1. How to read a waveform and vectorscope signal
**1.1 Waveform:** A waveform is used to evaluate the brightness/luminance of your image, regardless of the color. The units are in IRE, and there are a total of 140 of them. 

The illustration below is of a waveform monitor reticule. While it has several mysterious things included in the graphics, the most important are the horizontal lines that go from 100 at the top to -40 at the bottom with a heavy subdivided line about a third of the way up from the bottom at 0 on this scale. These are the primary measuring lines.

The video portion of the scale is from zero to one hundred, while the area below zero is for synchronizing signals. The area between 7.5 and 0 IRE is referred to as super black. While the technical issue that plagued early television sets has long ago been solved, this artificially high black level is the standard for NTSC video.Note also that there are two lines above 100 at 110 and 120 IRE. This is called the Superwhite area, where really strong light peaks (glints of the sun off shiny objects, for instance) may travel. What we perceive as white on a monitor is not 100 IRE but is actually around 75 to 85 IRE depending upon the visual content of the picture. So you should think of 100 IRE and above not as whites but as highlights that are a normal part of the picture. As an illustration, look at the waveform below on the left:

The image of the gray scale is represented in the waveform on the left. We see a simple “staircase” test signal that has levels at 0, 20, 40, 60, 80, and 100 IRE from the left to the right. The step on the left would be below black, the next step dark gray, the next step a bit lighter gray, and so on until we get to white.
