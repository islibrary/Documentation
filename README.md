# documentation

Welcome to the IS Library's GitHub page! Here you will find documentation for equipment and software programs in the IS Library and Media Preservation Lab. All of these pieces of documentation also live on the IS Library's Google Drive. For help with accessing documentation, or any other documentation-related questions, please reach out to us at islibrary@seis.ucla.edu.
